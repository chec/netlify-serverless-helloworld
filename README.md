# Commerce.js "hello world" serverless function on Netlify

This template provides a simple template to use for Netlify serverless functions with Express.js as a framework.
You can connect your Commerce.js store to functions like this in order to extend the options for functionality on
a Jamstack environment.

Some examples of things you could do:

* Print "Hello world!" to the console
* Automatically generate a discount code when a cart reaches a certain value threshold, and apply it to the cart
* Send your customers SMS messages when their orders are fulfilled

## Requirements

* Node.js
* Yarn or npm

## Getting started

You may clone this repository and deploy it straight to Netlify, although it may be better if you already have a
project on Netlify to include it as part of your existing project.
